- Data Scientist @ Imperial College London

## Education
### Imperial College London
Doctor of Philosophy - PhD, Computer Science
2015 – 2019
Graduating in 2019.

Provably correct non-convex optimisation.

Stochastic optimal control.


## University of Cambridge
MMath
2013 – 2014


## Volunteer Experience & Causes
- Regional and Micro Volunteer. The experience of participating in a Space Settlement Design Competition teaches young people optimism for the future, technical competence, management skills, knowledge of space environments and resources, appreciation for relationships between technical products and human use, teamwork, and techniques for preparing effective documentation. It requires that students integrate their knowledge of, and utilise skills in, space science, physics, maths, chemistry, environmental science, biology, computer science, writing, speaking, art, and common sense.
